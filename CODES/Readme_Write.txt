Write File (notes)
Python makes writing files very simple.

Here is an example of how to write a file in Python:

f = open("myfile.txt", "w")
f.write("This is my file!")
f.close()
What if you want to write line by line?

In Python, you can write data to a file line by line by using the write() method.



To do this, you first need to open the file in write mode. Then, you can use the write() method to write data to the file line by line.

Here is an example:

f = open('data.txt', 'w')
f.write('Line 1')
f.write('Line 2')
f.write('Line 3')
f.close()
In the example above, we first open the file in write mode. Then, we use the write() method to write three lines of data to the file. Finally, we close the file.



You can also use the writelines() method to write data to a file line by line. The writelines() method takes a list of strings as an argument and writes each string to the file on a separate line. Here is an example:

f = open('data.txt', 'w')
lines = ['Line 1', 'Line 2', 'Line 3']
f.writelines(lines)
f.close()
In the example above, we first create a list of strings. Then, we use the writelines() method to write the list of strings to the file. Finally, we close the file.



What about something other than text files?



In Python, you can write data to a CSV file using the csv module.

import csv
 
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
with open('output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    mywriter = csv.writer(csvfile, delimiter=',')
    mywriter.writerow(my_list)
To write data to a CSV file using the writer() function, you must first create a writer object. The writer object has a number of functions that can be used to write data to a CSV file. The most commonly used function is the writerow() function. The writerow() function takes a list of values and writes them to a row in the CSV file. The values in the list must be separated by the delimiter.
